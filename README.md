# Portfolio

I’m a data scientist with special interests in graphical models, graph theory, cognitive science, behavioral economics, and Bayesian methods. This repository holds a portfolio of some of my particular projects of interest.


A brief history of my experience, for those interested:
In undergrad, I double-majored in Economics and Business (Finance/Accounting focus) at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I worked at Moody’s Analytics for four years as Data Analyst and Data Operations Specialist, focusing on Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities. My responsibilities included the automation of data processing, development of new features and data sources, and the integration of data in general financial engineering and more specific client uses.

I have recently graduate from GalvanizeU with my Master’s in Data Science. I was fortunate enough to secure top marks in Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Special Topics courses, as well as for our final work produced via our industry internship.
