# Portfolio

I’m a data scientist with special focus on graphical methods, models, and theory, cognitive science, behavioral economics, and Bayesian methods. This repository holds a portfolio of some of my particular projects of interest. These include applications of neural nets, Doc2Vec, custom sentiment discovery, and graph analysis.


A brief history of my realted experience, for those interested:
In undergrad, I double-majored in Economics and Business (Finance/Accounting focus) at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I worked at Moody’s Analytics for four years as Data Analyst and Data Operations Specialist, focusing on Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities. My responsibilities included the automation of data processing, development of new features and data sources, and the integration of data in general financial engineering and more specific client uses.

I have recently graduated from GalvanizeU with my Master’s in Data Science. I was fortunate enough to secure top marks in Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Special Topics courses, as well as for our final work produced via our industry internship.

I most recently have worked at Silicon Valley Bank, studying venture capital. In particular I focused on using investor social networks, as measured by deal participation, to better understand, describe, and predict venture outcomes and investor behaviors. This included the use of both graphical methods and neural nets.
